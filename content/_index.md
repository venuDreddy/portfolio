I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer. My expertise spans both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to handle projects from concept to deployment. I specialize in technologies like React, Node.js, Postgres, and I’m always eager to learn and adapt to new tools and frameworks.

I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute to the development of innovative solutions that meet user needs. My approach to development focuses on performance optimization, clean code, and user-friendly interfaces. I’m committed to continuous learning and enjoy staying updated with the latest trends in the tech world.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing games or watching anime. I believe in the power of technology to make lives easier, and I’m excited to be a part of this dynamic field.
